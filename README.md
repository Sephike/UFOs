# UFOs
##Overview
The website that was created had good functionality, but Dana wanted a little more specfic information. Therefore we were tasked with adding filters to the existing website to further narrow the results. The filters that now exist are for the date, city, state, country, and shape.
## How to Use
The website is simple identify what you would like to narrow down on and search it. Let us say you want to search for a specfic shape of UFO. By going to the shape text field and putting in "Triangle" you will be given a list of entries all that have triangluar shaped sightings.
!["Triangle Results"]()
If you want to further narrow the results adding a city can help to make it very specfic.
!["Triangle and El Canjo Results"]()
